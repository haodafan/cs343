TEST CASES

#1: Sample Test
Input: 
8 25 6 8 5 99 100 101 7
3 1 3 5
0
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Output: 
5 6 7 8 25 99 100 101
1 3 5

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Purpose: 
In addition to covering some test cases with basic trees, it also covers edge cases involving no input and a tree composed of only left children.

#2: Same Input Test
Input:
10 12 12 12 4 4 4 4 12 12 12 
4 5 5 5 5
Output: 
4 4 4 4 12 12 12 12 12 12
5 5 5 5
Purpose: 
Tests the edge case where the numbers have the same value 

#3: Right leaning tree test
Input: 
10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Output: 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Purpose: 
Where the sample test includes one which tests a long tree composed of only left children, this one conntains only right children. 

#4: One Test 
Input: 
1 1
Output: 
1
Purpose: 
Tests the edge case of only one single node

#5: Complete Test 
Input: 
15 8 4 12 2 6 10 14 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15
Output: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
Purpose: 
Tests a completely balanced tree with at least two levels of both left and right children. This should ensure most of the control flow is tested properly.
