(b)
It takes significantly more time to run the program with the EXTERNAL flag than with the INTERNAL flag. 

The difference between the two is the buffering style (internal buffering vs external buffering). 
The external buffer is slower because it is slower to constantly append onto a string (which may require memory reallocation) than it is to syscall output a number each time (which requires an integer to string conversion as well).

(c)

External buffering still takes more time, however it is more efficient than without compiler optimizations. There is not much of a difference between optimized and unoptimized internal buffering.

(d)
Performance difference using '\n' instead of endl

-DINTERNAL
1.98u 0.13s 0:02.14

-DEXTERNAL 
5.60u 0.14s 0:05.75

-DINTERNAL -O2
1.86u 0.13s 0:01.99

-DEXTERNAL -O2
3.57u 0.23s 0:03.81

Marginally faster!
