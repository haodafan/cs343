=========== (b) ===========
(i) 
Throw catch statements automatically call the destructors of any objects created in the function that's throwing if the function exits. Longjmp does no such thing.

(iii) 
There is a large performance difference between the original try/catch program and setjmp/longjmp program. The cause is likely due to the large amount of overhead and processes which try/catch statements run (e.g. they need to call destructors). 

(iv) 
There is also a large performance difference for the optimized programs.
